Hello and welcome to my site. I am a first-year Master's Student in Controls and Autonomy in the Aerospace Engineering Department at the University of Michigan. My focus is on robust, perception-aware autonomous systems, particularly as it relates to quadrotor control. I am  a member of the Intelligent Robotics and Autonomy Lab (IRAL), headed by [Dr. Tzoumas](https://vasileiostzoumas.com). I am also an avid snowboarder and guitarist, and have a Sheepadoodle named Hoback with my partner. I currently drive a 1979 BMW 733i, and will be posting modifications that I make to it under the blog section of this site.
